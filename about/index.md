    <p>At present I am in the department of mathematics at the University of Vermont, where I am completing a masters in applied math. I'm also a teaching assistant in the department, instructing Calculus 019 Sections and assisting with Real Analysis and Linear Algebra. </p> 
    
    <p>Early on my research activities focused on developing models to determine fluid flow through stream bed substrates. Intreagued by the differential equations and the non-deterministic behaviour in fluid dynamics. Furthermore, my experience in C++ coding grew through an opportunity through a collaboration between the ATLAS Large Hadron Collider Experiment housed at CERN in conjunction with the Department of Physics at UMass Amherst. After growing my interests in dynamical systems and its contexts in physics.</p>

<p markdown="1">Previously, I completed a core curriculum in Enginnering and a thesis on Freshwater Hydrology and Riparian Conservation Methodologies at Hampshire College. In a surprising turn of events, positions in applied computer science at the University of Massachusetts Department of Physics and The Rubenstein School of Natural Resources at UVM fueld my interests in thinking deeply about pure math.
