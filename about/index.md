Previously I completed an thesis on Freshwater Hydrology and Riparian Methodologies at Hampshire College as an extension of an engineering core focus. After college in a surprising turn of events, applied computer science positions at the University of Massachusetts Department of Physics  and The Rubenstein School of Natural Resources at UVM, my desires for pure math instigated a return to graduate school.
