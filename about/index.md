    <p>At present I am in the department of mathematics at the University of Vermont, where I am completing a masters in applied math. I'm also a teaching assistant in the department, instructing Calculus 019 Sections and assisting with Real Analysis and Linear Algebra. </p> 
    
    <p>Early on my research activities focused on developing computer models to determine fluid flow through stream bed substrates. I soon gravitated towards investigating the physics and differential equations governing non-deterministic behaviour in fluid dynamics and through an opportunity through a collaboration between the ATLAS Large Hadron Collider Experiment housed at CERN in conjunction with the Department of Physics at UMass Amherst. I furthered my experience in C++ coding and applied mathematics while simultaniously occupying a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research outreach position at the University of Vermont. Successful supplemental coursework during two years working with NOAA lead to a secured a fully funded position in mathematics. Currently, I participate in resaerch activities includeing differential equation models for contagion and capturing the quatification and volume of social media discourse during natural disaster and  intensified political events. A vision for my future research includes revisiting math and physics governing high energy physics as well as remaining grounded with socially engaged research. </p>

<p markdown="1">Previously, I completed a core curriculum in Enginnering and a thesis on Freshwater Hydrology and Riparian Conservation Methodologies at Hampshire College. In a surprising turn of events, positions in applied computer science at the University of Massachusetts Department of Physics and The Rubenstein School of Natural Resources at UVM fueld my interests in thinking deeply about pure math.
