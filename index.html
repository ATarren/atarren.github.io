	<h1>Amelia Tarren</h1>
	
	<p> Welcome!</p>
	
	<p> My motivations center around developing innovative solutions to applied mathematics, including complex systems research questions that employ technical and logic based skillsets; systems from which emergent properties arise from nonlinear localized dynamics. My academic foundations and experience are underpinned by a commitment to teamwork and diversity in work settings. I've worked in physics, environmental engineering, and research management sectors for the past six years. Also, I enjoy looking for excuses to problem solve both in pure and applied mathematics as well as the occasional geometrically demanding rock climbing crux. All Wonderful Things. Creativity and out of the box thinking are certainly "food groups" throughout my days.</p>
